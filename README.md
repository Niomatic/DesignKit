# DesignKit, Niomatic IOT hardware solution
Niomatic, meaning of "n Input Output self-perform" is an Android based platform for a visual programming language from NIO Group. This platform performs to execute on low power consumption and limited resource hardware applications.

###Niomatic Democratic language

The platform is completely free and unrestricted for all public, educational, and non-commercial purposes. Visual programming application, Nio platform, can be often used in easy teaching coding and computer science. The graphical approach also enables zero-code to build enterprise-grade applications by dragging and dropping blocks that representing codes and functionality.

###Prospect

Providing opportunities in the electronic and computer field at the lowest cost, fastest time and eliminating repetitive tasks in the way of creating value.

##Applet

###The applet is the next generation of application.

Create an Applet platform that provides full-stack application solution based on new visual programming concept. The platform will have a widespread use of the Internet of Things. in the other words, we're working on creating the new generation of apps - the applet.
The applets are small executable files that have the same functionality as the app but have a much smaller volume.
The applets are designed and developed by developers and businesses. Designing these applets does not require specialized programming knowledge, they are graphically arranged and put together blocks and connect them.
